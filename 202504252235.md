# MESH CURRENT AND NODE VOLTAGE NETWORK ANALYSIS

## Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws

### Voltage Law i.e. Loop Law

_The algebraic sum of all the potential difference along a closed loop in a circuit is zero._

> When we are going opposite to the current, voltage is added and when we are going with the current we subtract.

### Current Law i.e. Junction Law

_The sum of all the currents directed towards a point in a circuit is equal to the sum of all the currents directed away from the point._

> The algebraic sum of all the currents directed towards a point is zero

## Nodal and Mesh Analysis

### Nodal Analysis

In this method, a node (junction) is taken as **ground** (reference point), so we will assume it has 0 V. Out of _N_ nodes that are there in the circuit, there are now _N - 1_ nodes left. Using the **Ground** node, we assign different variable to the left _N - 1_ nodes to solve the _**Voltage Law**_. We can also use the _N - 1_ nodes to solve _**Junction Law**_.

> In a resistor only circuit, there will be **N - 1** equations for each N - 1 nodes in the circuit.

After the solving the equations, we get the voltages of the nodes. Using this, we can obtain the current and voltage of anything in the circuit.

In this circuit the lower 2 nodes are the same so I merged them into the circuit on the right.

Lets make the equations of Node 1 and Node 2.
$$
\begin{align*}
(G_1 + G_2)v_1 - G_1v_2 = i_1 \\
- G_1v_1 + (G_1 + G_3)v_2 = -i_2
\end{align*}
$$

The above equations can also be written as a matrix: 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
G_1 + G_2 & -G_1 \\
-G_1 & (G_1 + G_3)
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
i_1 \\
-i_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where 
**`[v]`** = vector of node voltages
**`[G]`** = node admittance matrix, whose
$$
\begin{align*}
\sum \ a_{ij} = \sum admittances \ of \ the \ node
\end{align*}
$$
Using this equation, we can find the current and voltage.
