# Impedance

$$
\begin{gathered}
\vec{Z} = R + jX
\end{gathered}
$$
It is the sum of the resistance component and an imaginary component of impedance. Its unit is ohms.

# Reactance

$$
\begin{gathered}
X_C = \frac{1}{\omega C} \\ \\
X_L = \omega L
\end{gathered}
$$

# Admittance

$$
\begin{gathered}
\vec{Y} = G + yB \\ \\
\vec{Y} = \frac{1}{\vec{Z}}
\end{gathered}
$$

where G = Conductance and,
	  B = Susceptance
