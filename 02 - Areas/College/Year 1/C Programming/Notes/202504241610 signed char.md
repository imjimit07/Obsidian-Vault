# %d and %c in signed char

When printing a signed char, %d and %c have different outputs.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
     char a = 100;
     
     printf("%c\n", a);
     printf("%d", a);

    return 0;
}
/* 
Output:
d
100
*/
```

Here we see that the %c prints a letter whereas %d prints an integer. When %c is used, the number stored in the variable will print the **ASCII** character for that number. Since 100 is the decimal number for the letter ‘d’, thus it prints “d” as it’s output.
